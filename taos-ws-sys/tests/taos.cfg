# Maximum reconnection wait time. The maximum time to wait when a request fails. To prevent
# all clients from synchronizing on retries, a random jitter of 0.2 is applied to the backoff
# time, keeping it within 20% of the calculated value. If retryBackoffMs is set higher than
# retryBackoffMaxMs, retryBackoffMaxMs will be used as the constant backoff time from the beginning.
